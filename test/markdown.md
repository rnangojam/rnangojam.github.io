Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
var foo = "bar";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var foo = "bar";
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```javascript
var foo =
  "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language   | Code               |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Javascript | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby       | `foo = "bar"`      |

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![Octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![Branching](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
