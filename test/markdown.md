ROS 2는 여러 환경에서 사용이 가능하다. 예를 들어 Ubuntu, Docker, WSL 등등이 있다. 그중에서 WSL2를 이용하여 ROS 2를 사용하기 위한 밑작업을 할 예정이다.

# WSL2 설정

WSL은 Window Subsystem for Linux의 약자로 윈도우 환경에서 리눅스 환경을 사용할 수 있도록 해주는 기능이다. 이를 이용하여 Ubuntu 22.04를 설치할 예정이다.

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

Here is an unordered list:

- Salt-n-Pepa
- Bel Biv DeVoe
- Kid 'N Play

And an ordered list:

1. Michael Jackson
2. Michael Bolton
3. Michael Bublé

And an unordered task list:

- [x] Create a sample markdown document
- [x] Add task lists to it
- [ ] Take a vacation

And a "mixed" task list:

- [ ] Steal underpants
- ?
- [ ] Profit!

And a nested list:

- Jackson 5
  - Michael
  - Tito
  - Jackie
  - Marlon
  - Jermaine
- TMNT
  - Leonardo
  - Michelangelo
  - Donatello
  - Raphael

Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax. Definition terms are bold and italic.

<dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Godzilla</dd>
    <dt>Born</dt>
    <dd>1952</dd>
    <dt>Birthplace</dt>
    <dd>Japan</dd>
    <dt>Color</dt>
    <dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
var foo = "bar";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var foo = "bar";
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```javascript
var foo =
  "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language   | Code               |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Javascript | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby       | `foo = "bar"`      |

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![Octocat](https://koreatechackr-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/1324werqt_koreatech_ac_kr/EU75X-Z51BFNoknxpcPg_5gBJI4e9DuvK406FbFVOJ3UPg?e=d0e03v)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![Branching](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
